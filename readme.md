SuperMassive is a massively scalable, in-memory, distributed, sharded, fault-tolerant, and self-healing key-value database.

## Features

- **Highly scalable** Scale horizontally with ease.  Simply add more nodes to the cluster.
- **Distributed** Data is distributed across multiple nodes in a sharded fashion.
- **Robust Health Checking System** Health checks are performed on all nodes, if any node is marked unhealthy we will try to recover it.
- **Smart Data Distribution** uses a sequence-based round-robin approach for distributing writes across primary nodes.  This ensures that all primary nodes get an equal share of writes.
- **Automatic Fail-over** Automatic fail-over of primary nodes on write failure. If a primary node is unavailable for a write, we go to the next available primary node.
- **Parallel Read Operations** Read operations are performed in parallel.
- **Consistency Management** Timestamp-based version control to handle conflicts. The most recent value is always returned, the rest are deleted.
- **Fault-tolerant** Replication and fail-over are supported. If a node goes down, the cluster will continue to function.
- **Self-healing** Automatic data recovery.  A node can recover from a journal.  A node replica can recover from a primary node via a check point like algorithm.
- **Simple Protocol** Simple protocol `PUT`, `GET`, `DEL`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `REGX`, `STAT`, `RCNF`, `PING`.
- **Async Node Journal** Operations are written to a journal asynchronously.  This allows for fast writes and recovery.
- **Multi-platform** Linux, Windows, MacOS
- **Thoroughly Tested** Extensive unit and integration tests for different scenarios.  We are **always** looking for more tests to add.

## Getting Started

<div>
    <h1 align="left"><img width="528" src="artwork/supermassive-netcat-example.gif"></h1>
</div>

You can use TLS for your client-cluster communication and cluster-node node-replica communication.  A cluster can be started with TLS and so can other instance types based on configuration files.

When starting a cluster instance you provide a `--username` and `--password`.  When accessing through a client like netcat you now need to authenticate with `AUTH user\0password`.

The `user\0password` should be encoded in base64.

There is only 1 user for the system.  You set it, you can change the user credentials any restart.
It is advisable to call an environment variable to populate these flags or another method to keep the password secure.

Starting either a cluster, node, or node replica you always also provide a `--shared-key` flag which is used to authentication cluster to node, node to node replica communication.
All keys in the chain must match for communication to be successful.  This should also be kept secure.

```bash
(echo -n "AUTH " && echo -n $"username\\0password" | base64 && cat) | nc -C localhost 4000
OK authenticated
```

`-C` is used for CRLF line endings.  This is required for the protocol.

A cluster requires nodes to write to.  By default `.cluster`, `.node`, `.nodereplica` yaml configs are created.
These configurations give you an example of how a cluster is setup with 1 node and 1 replica.

### Configurations

**Cluster**

```yaml
health-check-interval: 2
server-config:
    address: localhost:4000
    use-tls: false
    cert-file: /
    key-file: /
    read-timeout: 10
    buffer-size: 1024
node-configs:
    - node:
        server-address: localhost:4001
        use-tls: false
        ca-cert-file: ""
        connect-timeout: 5
        write-timeout: 5
        read-timeout: 5
        max-retries: 3
        retry-wait-time: 1
        buffer-size: 1024
      replicas:
        - server-address: localhost:4002
          use-tls: false
          ca-cert-file: ""
          connect-timeout: 5
          write-timeout: 5
          read-timeout: 5
          max-retries: 3
          retry-wait-time: 1
          buffer-size: 1024

```
You can add more nodes and replicas to the cluster by adding more `node-configs`.
A `node` acts as a primary shard and a `replica` acts as a read replica to the primary shard.

**Node**

```yaml
health-check-interval: 2
max-memory-threshold: 75
server-config:
    address: localhost:4001
    use-tls: false
    cert-file: /
    key-file: /
    read-timeout: 10
    buffer-size: 1024
read-replicas:
    - server-address: localhost:4002
      use-tls: false
      ca-cert-file: /
      connect-timeout: 5
      write-timeout: 5
      read-timeout: 5
      max-retries: 3
      retry-wait-time: 1
      buffer-size: 1024

```

**Node Replica**

```yaml
server-config:
    address: localhost:4002
    use-tls: false
    cert-file: /
    key-file: /
    read-timeout: 10
    buffer-size: 1024
max-memory-threshold: 75
```

```

> [!NOTE]
> There are NO transactions.  All commands except PUT, PING are ran in parallel.  PUT selects 1 node based on current sequence and writes to it.  On get, we always return the most recent value of a key.  If there are multiple values for a key only 1 value lives on if this occurs, rest are deleted.


## Replica consistency?

When a replica is down, the primary node will not be able to write to it.  The primary node will continue to write to the other replicas.
When the replica comes back up, the primary node will send the missing data to the replica.  The replica will then be in sync with the primary node.

This is using the journal pages and a specific piece of the protocol
A primary after connected to replica will send a `STARTSYNC`, a replica will then send a `SYNCFROM pgnum` where pgnum is the last page number in the replica journal.  The primary will then send missing operations to the replica.

**Communication looks like this**
1. Replica goes online, primary connects to replica sends `STARTSYNC`
2. Replica sends `SYNCFROM pgnum` to primary
3. Primary starts sending pages to replica until it reaches end of its journal
4. Replica writes pages to its journal
5. PRIMARY is done sending pages to replica once `DONESYNC` is sent to replica
6. Primary and replica are now in sync

## All nodes are full?
Add more nodes to the cluster.  The cluster will automatically distribute the data across the new nodes.
Primaries can shrink based on deletes allowing more data to be written over time based on new values taking precedence.
